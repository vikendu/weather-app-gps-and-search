# weather-app-gps-and-search
This app uses open weather's api to get weather by either using the gps co-ordinates or by name, this app implements INTENT and HTTP asynchronous Client.
Use your own API key. You can get free API key on openweathermaps.com

Update:
This app can only be used by me and my family members, to share each other's location as well as the weather in their current location using FireBaseDB.
